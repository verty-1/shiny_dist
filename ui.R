         The application displays the distribution of 200 repeat measurements taken
         for each test. A Welchâ€™s T-Test determines if the difference in the mean values
         for the two tests was statistically significant. The user can change
         the slider to select other mean values for Test_2 and estimate the
         threshold for detecting measurement differences based on the P Value.
         Raw T-Test results can be suppressed by clicking the check box.")
